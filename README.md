## Get to Know the Author
**Simon**
has worked in the high-tech industry for over 20 years, in roles as diverse as software engineer, product manager, project manager, support engineer, and operations manager. However, most of his time has been spent breaking other peopleâ€™s code as a tester and test manager.
He has worked in organizations as small as thirty people and as large as some of the biggest tech companies in the world; he has seen companies go out of business and worked in those acquired for their technology.
All that experience has given him a deep insight into the development process. In particular, he knows the problems cause by inadequate testing, and how to solve them.
